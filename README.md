# Interview_Questions
This branch is mainly for the Interview Questions that Hector Wei recently done on Leetcode.com

# Disclaimer: 
Most (while some are contributed by my friends) of these files are written in their entirety by me, Hector Wei, studying as a student major in Computer Science and Combinatorics and Optimization at the University of Waterloo. I have no intentions of violating any UW policies and will gladly honour takedown notices produced by an authorized UW representative. They are by no means authoritative so use at your own peril. Feel free to follow me in practicing for interviews!
